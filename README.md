# **Mini Project 2 - ECoG Data Analysis**

## **Project Overview**
This project analyzes **Electrocorticography (ECoG) data** to compute and visualize **Event-Related Potentials (ERP)** associated with finger movements. The goal is to extract brain signals corresponding to finger movements, process them, and generate an averaged response for each finger.

## **Dataset Description**
- **`events_file_ordered.csv`**: Contains timestamps for trial start points, peak points, and associated finger movement (1-5).
- **`brain_data_channel_one.csv`**: A single-channel time-series dataset recording brain activity.

## **Methodology**
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Read and clean trial event data (`events_file_ordered.csv`).
   - Load and format ECoG signal data (`brain_data_channel_one.csv`).

2. **ERP Computation**:
   - Extract brain signal segments around each movement event.
   - Compute the **mean ERP** for each finger by averaging across trials.

3. **Visualization**:
   - Generate ERP plots for each finger.
   - Display the final processed ERP matrix.

## **How to Run**
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <https://github.com/disruptwood/miniproject2>
Open Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter notebook
Run analysis.ipynb to execute the ERP analysis.
Example ERP Output
The script generates a 5x1201 matrix, where each row represents the averaged brain response for one of the five fingers.
Libraries Used
pandas (for data manipulation)
numpy (for numerical operations)
